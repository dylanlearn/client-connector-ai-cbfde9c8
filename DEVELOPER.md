## Project Overview

Wireframe Studio is an enterprise-grade application for creating, editing, and managing interactive wireframes. It provides a canvas-based environment for designing UI layouts with responsive preview capabilities and AI-assisted features.

### Key Features

- Interactive wireframe editor with responsive design support
- Component library with customizable sections
- Multi-device preview
- AI-assisted design suggestions
- Enterprise observability and error tracking
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Zustand for UI state
- **Visualization**: Fabric.js for canvas operations
- **Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Charts & Graphics**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for UI animations
- **Drag and Drop**: react-beautiful-dnd for sortable interfaces
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based architecture with shared components:

```

│   ├── admin/          # Admin panel components
│   ├── design/         # Design system components
│   ├── error-handling/ # Error boundary and monitoring
│   ├── feedback/       # User feedback components
│   ├── intake/         # Intake form components
│   ├── layout/         # Layout components (headers, sidebars)

```

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. Run tests: `npm run test`
5. Build for production: `npm run build`

### Git Workflow

We follow a feature branch workflow:

1. Create a feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes with descriptive commit messages
3. Push your branch and create a pull request
4. Ensure all tests pass and code meets quality standards
5. Request a code review
6. Merge to main after approval

## Component Architecture

### Component Design Principles

1. **Composition over inheritance**: Break down complex components into smaller, reusable parts
2. **Single responsibility**: Each component should have a focused purpose
3. **Props interface**: Every component should have well-defined prop interfaces
4. **Error boundaries**: Use error boundaries for component-level error handling
5. **Responsive design**: All components should adapt to different screen sizes

### Wireframe Component Structure

Wireframe components follow this hierarchy:

- `WireframeStudio`: Main container component
  - `WireframeCanvas`: Canvas-based editor
    - `SectionRendererFactory`: Renders different section types
      - Specialized section renderers (HeroSection, FeaturesSection, etc.)
        - `ComponentRendererFactory`: Renders individual components

## Type System

### Type Safety Guidelines

1. **Explicit typing**: Always define explicit return types for functions and components
2. **Strict mode**: TypeScript strict mode is enabled project-wide
3. **Type guards**: Use type guards for runtime type checking
4. **Shared interfaces**: Define shared interfaces in dedicated type files
5. **Discriminated unions**: Use discriminated unions for complex state management

### Key Type Definitions

The most important type interfaces are:

- `WireframeSection`: Defines the structure of wireframe sections
- `WireframeComponent`: Defines individual components within sections
- `ComponentDefinition`: Defines component library entries
- `DeviceType`: Defines supported device types for responsive design

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Goals

- Unit tests: 80% coverage for utility functions
- Component tests: 70% coverage for UI components
- Integration tests: 60% coverage for connected components
- E2E tests: Critical user flows

### Testing Guidelines

1. Test business logic thoroughly
2. Focus on user interactions for component tests
3. Mock external dependencies
4. Test error handling paths
5. Verify accessibility compliance

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing procedures.

## Error Handling

### Error Handling Strategy

1. **Component-level**: Use ErrorBoundary components
2. **API errors**: Consistent error handling for network requests
3. **Monitoring**: Track client-side errors for resolution
4. **User feedback**: Clear error messages for users
5. **Recovery paths**: Graceful degradation when possible

### Error Reporting

All errors should be captured through the `recordClientError` function to ensure proper tracking and resolution.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Component memoization**: Use React.memo for expensive components
2. **Virtualization**: Use virtualized lists for large datasets
3. **Code splitting**: Use dynamic imports for route-level code splitting
4. **Image optimization**: Optimize images for faster loading
5. **Debouncing**: Debounce frequent events like resize or scroll

### Monitoring Performance

Use the built-in performance monitoring utilities to track:

- Component render times
- API response times
- Animation performance
- Memory usage

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow a consistent code style enforced by ESLint and Prettier. Key points:

1. Use functional components with hooks
2. Prefer destructuring for props
3. Use named exports except for default component exports
4. Document complex logic with comments
5. Keep components under 300 lines (refactor if larger)

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add test coverage for new features
4. Get approval from at least one reviewer
5. Squash commits when merging
