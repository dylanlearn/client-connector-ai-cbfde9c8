    This wireframe was designed based on the description: "${description}".
    
    The color scheme uses ${options.colorScheme.primary} as primary and 
    ${options.colorScheme.secondary} as secondary to create visual hierarchy.
    
    Typography uses ${options.typography.headings} for headings and 
    ${options.typography.body} for body text to ensure readability.
    
    The layout includes ${options.sections.length} sections to present 
    information in a clear, structured manner.
