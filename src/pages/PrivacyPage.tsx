        <p>
          Your privacy is important to us. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect 
          from you across our website and other sites we own and operate.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>Log Data</h3>

          When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser. 
          This data is considered "non-identifying information", as it does not personally identify you on its own. 
          It may include your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you 
          visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details.

        <p>
          We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. 
          We collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your 
          information only where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>it's necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your 
              request before entering into such a contract;</li>
          <li>it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests);</li>
          <li>you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>
          <li>we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>

          We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following purposes:

          <li>to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect 
          it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, 
          copying, use or modification.

        <h2>How Long We Keep Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are 
          using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have provided us with 
          personal information as part of creating an account with us, we may retain this information for the duration 
          your account exists on our system. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we 
          will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.

          personal information.

          At our discretion, we may change our privacy policy to reflect updates to our business processes, current acceptable 
          practices, or legislative or regulatory changes. If we decide to change this privacy policy, we will post the changes here.
